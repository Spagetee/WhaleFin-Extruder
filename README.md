# WhaleFin-Extruder
3d printer Extruder based on Sailfin, and Sherpamini extruders
The design uses BMG gears. I made this cos the Sailfin and Sherpamini did not line up with my bmg clone gears from aliexpress. Additionally the spring has been shifted from the left to right with the tensoning knob now threading into the ideler arm. This gives the extruder a thinner profile. This extruder has more space for the larger gear, as well as adapts the hexagonal hole shape for the filament used in the Sherpa mini. The motor is also rotated up slightly.

TDLR 
main advantages
- thinner side to side profile
- more compatablitiy with clone bmg gears
- slightly higher motor placement

Potential issues
- it is thicker than the sherpamini and sailfin by ~ 1mm in the back 
- heavier than both extruders (i think)
